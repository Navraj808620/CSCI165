Toronto, the capital of the province of Ontario, is a major Canadian city along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. 
<br>
It's a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN Tower. 
<br>
Toronto also has many green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queen’s Park to 400-acre High Park and its trails,
<br>
sports facilities and zoo.
